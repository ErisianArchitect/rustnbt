/// Macro used for accessing the tag info table which contains information
/// about all the tag types, their tag name, their type, and the last column is for implementations.
/// Implementations are applied to the type of the tag.
/// So for example: Tag::Byte is i8, so we would implement Primitive for i8.
/// Implementations:
///            Primitive: Marker that tells the compiler that this is a known-sized type and should be treated as such.
///              NonByte: Marker that tells the compiler that this is a type that is not 8-bits wide.
///     NonBytePrimitive: Marker that combines the Primitive and NonByte marker.
/// Usage:
/// ```no_run
/// macro_rules! read_table {
///     //             $id: The tag ID that is written to file to mark a type. These are distinct integer values.
///     //                  Typically the ID will be a single 8-bit value, but as the extensions become more advanced, this may change.
///     //          $title: This is the title of this NBT type. This is different from the type name, and is used as the names of 
///     //                  variants in the TagID and Tag enums.
///     //           $type: The type that the tag holds and serializes/deserializes.
///     //           $impl: These are trait implementations that are applied to the types. These traits do not do anything besides act as markers.
///     ($($id:literal $title:ident $type:path [$($impl:path),*])+) => {
///         // generation code here.
///     }
/// }
///
/// tag_info_table!(read_table);
